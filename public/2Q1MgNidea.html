 <h2>History of Ateneo</h2>
  <p>
    Founded in the year 1859, Ateneo de Manila University traces its roots back to when Spanish Jesuits established the Escuela Municipal de Manila, a public primary school in Intramuros, Manila. This institution was part of the Jesuits' broader educational mission, which began in the Philippines with the founding of the Colegio de Manila in 1590. The school was renamed Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1865 and began offering secondary education, focusing on a liberal arts curriculum that emphasized the humanities. In the year 1902, during the American Colonial period, Ateneo became a private institution and was officially renamed Ateneo De Manila. The university faced challenges, including the destruction of its original campus by fire in 1932 and further devastation during World War II. After the war, Ateneo relocated to its current campus in Loyola Heights, Quezon City, in 1952. In the modern era, Ateneo de Manila University is recognized as an institution in pursuit of academic excellence and social justice. It offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs across various fields, including the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, and business. The university is also known for its active engagement in community service and social issues through various programs and initiatives.
